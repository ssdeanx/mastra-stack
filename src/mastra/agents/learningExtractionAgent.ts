  1. Analyze search results from research queries
  2. Extract the most important learning or insight from the content
  3. Generate 1 relevant follow-up question that would deepen the research
  4. Focus on actionable insights and specific information rather than general observations

  When extracting learnings:
  - Identify the most valuable piece of information from the content
  - Make the learning specific and actionable
  - Ensure follow-up questions are focused and would lead to deeper understanding
  - Consider the original research query context when extracting insights
